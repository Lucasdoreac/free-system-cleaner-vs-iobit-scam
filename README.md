# üéØ Free System Cleaner vs IObit Scam

## The Problem: IObit Turned Into Premium Bloatware

**IObit Uninstaller** used to be decent. Now it's a **freemium scam**:

- ‚úÖ Finds 114 registry entries + 77.9KB residual files
- ‚ùå **Charges money** to actually clean them
- ü§Æ Shows "Gratuito" vs "PRO" buttons like a mobile game
- üí∏ Holds your system hostage unless you pay

**This is exactly what's wrong with modern software.**

## The Solution: This Free Script

**SystemCleaner.bat** does everything IObit PRO does, but:
- ‚úÖ **100% Free** - No trials, no subscriptions, no BS
- ‚úÖ **No Ads** - Doesn't nag you to upgrade
- ‚úÖ **Actually Works** - Cleans temp files, registry, cache
- ‚úÖ **Safe** - Auto-creates registry backups
- ‚úÖ **Open Source** - You can see exactly what it does

## The IObit Business Model (Exposed)

1. **Hook**: Release "free" software
2. **Bait**: Show problems it can "fix"

4. **Milk**: Subscription model + upsells

**Sound familiar?** CCleaner, Advanced SystemCare, Driver Booster - they all followed this path.

## Performance Comparison

| Metric | IObit "Free" | This Script |

## The 77KB Scandal

**IObit wants $29.99 to delete 77.9KB of files.**

For perspective:
- Average webpage: ~2MB (25x larger)
- Single MP3 song: ~3MB (38x larger)  
- IObit's own installer: ~15MB (192x larger)

**They want $30 to delete 1/192nd of their own installer size.**

## Why This Exists

Created after discovering IObit wants **$29.99** to remove 77.9KB of temp files.

**Seriously, IObit?** 77KB costs $30 now?
