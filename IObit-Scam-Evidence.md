# 📸 Evidence: IObit Uninstaller Paywall Scam

## The Screenshot That Started It All

IObit Uninstaller detected:
- **114 unnecessary registry entries**
- **77.9 KB residual files**

Then showed this interface:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐

│                                         │

│  Automatic exclusion of residual files  │
│     ❌                     ✅          │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Translation: "Pay Us or Your System Stays Dirty"

**What IObit is saying:**
- "We found the problems" ✅
- "We can fix them" ✅  
- "But only if you pay" 🤑

**What they should say:**
- "Here's what we found, cleaning now..."

## The 77KB Scandal

**77.9 KB** = 0.000077 GB

IObit wants **$29.99** to delete files smaller than a single photo.

For perspective:
- Average webpage: ~2MB (25x larger)
- Single MP3 song: ~3MB (38x larger)
- IObit's own installer: ~15MB (192x larger)

**They want $30 to delete 1/192nd of their own installer size.**

## The Registry Entries Scam

**114 "unnecessary" registry entries**

In reality:
- Windows registry has ~500,000+ entries
- 114 orphaned entries = 0.02% of total
- Impact on performance: **negligible**
- Impact on IObit's wallet: **$29.99**

## The Freemium Trap

### Step 1: The Hook
- Download "free" IObit Uninstaller
- Looks legitimate, gets good reviews
- Actually uninstalls programs (basic function)

### Step 2: The Scan
- "We found issues with your system!"
- Shows impressive numbers (114 entries!)
- Creates anxiety about system health

### Step 3: The Paywall
- "Click here to fix" → "Upgrade to PRO"
- $29.99 for "deep cleaning"
- Monthly subscription for "real-time protection"

### Step 4: The Psychological Pressure
- "Your system is at risk!"
- "77.9KB of junk slowing you down!"
- Timer countdowns, limited-time offers

## How They Justify It

**IObit's Marketing:**
- "Professional cleanup tools"
- "Advanced registry optimization"
- "Premium features for power users"

**Reality:**
- Basic file deletion (Windows can do this)
- Registry cleanup (RegEdit can do this)
- Uninstaller interface (Windows has this built-in)

## The Bigger Picture

This isn't just about IObit. It's about **software enshittification**:

1. **Create useful free tool**
2. **Build user base**
3. **Add premium features** 
4. **Paywall basic functionality**
5. **Profit from user dependency**

### Other Examples:
- **CCleaner**: Free → Freemium → Subscription
- **WinRAR**: "40-day trial" for 20+ years → Subscription push
- **Malwarebytes**: Free → Premium required for real-time
- **Driver Booster**: Free scans → Paid updates

## The Irony

IObit Uninstaller has become exactly the kind of software it was designed to remove: **bloatware that nags you for money.**
